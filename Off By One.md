I realized today I made a typical mistake for a programmer. I made a list off by one.

My Zeroth failure was people. When I was in middle school, I was bullied to the point that I was diagnosed with depression. I went to a therapist and took wellbutrin. I refused to let that happen. I deviated.

I fear no one now.

Speak out against mental illnesses and bullying. Others need to hear it. Getting bullied isn't the end. It's only the beginning.

Prove everyone wrong.
