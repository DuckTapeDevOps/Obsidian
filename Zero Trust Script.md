Good Morning, Good Afternoon, Good Evening.

Today we're going to talk about Zero Trust and how to easily implement it on an API using the Open Source framework OpenZiti and it's SaaS provider Free Tier known as CloudZiti Teams.

This demo will take you from zero understanding of zero trust to having a working API with Zero Trust enabled in less than an hour. 

First let's talk about how you got here!

Let's imagine you found Ziti at a conference. Often, after a speech at a conference a potential customer will come by our booth after and ask "So I saw your demo, and I agree, Ziti is the best way to implement Zero Trust." 

"Well that's great, we agree! What can we do to get you into a new Zero Trust framework today?"

They might ask "App embedded OpenZiti is definitely the most secure way to do Zero Trust , but do you have anything more plug-and-play?"

"You've activated my demo trap!"

So, what are we doing today? Today we'll shift from end-to-end app embedded, which our eager new friend mentioned is the most secure way to do Zero Trust, to ZTHA (ZiTi, or Zero Trust, Host Access). 

Here's what we'll need:
An AWS Account and AWS CLI access for that account
Terraform 1.0.1+
