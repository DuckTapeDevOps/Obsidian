Nonpareil Altruism is about doing your absolute best to change the world. It can be in the form of charity events or, as I do, writing Open Source code that will help the world grow while giving a reasonable amount of the proceeds to charities.  

# My First Post

## Welcome to GOAT(Greatest Of All Time) week.

The importance of yesterday's World Cup win by Argentina and Lionel Messi is often lost on Americans. Yet, it is undeniable that soccer is the most popular and accessible sport in the world.

"According to official data from FIFA, an estimated 3.575 billion people watched matches at the 2018 World Cup, with 1.12bn tuning in for France's final win over Croatia in Moscow."

It can only be assumed that even more watched yesterday with how much more accessible technology gets every year and the match up between Mbappe and Messi.

Yesterday, Messi cemented his name (in many minds) as the GOAT of the most popular sport in the world. That has a lasting impact on society.

This week, kids that watched Messi become the GOAT and achieve his life's dream will begin to believe that their own dreams are possible. And one of those dreams may just change the world forever.

## Other GOAT Moments

The first GOAT moment I remember was in 1996 when I watched Michael Johnson move the world. When he left those blocks on his way to break multiple world records, the track literally ripped behind him because he threw so much force into them. He was the GOAT of sprinting for a long time.

The second GOAT moment I had the pleasure of watching was in 1999 in Metz, France when Lance Armstrong blew away the competition to win his first yellow jersey that he only temporarily let go of for 7 years. Obviously, that has been a bit tainted since.

A GOAT moment unrelated to sports I can think of was the first time SpaceX managed to land a rocket. The reaction of those engineers who'd worked all their lives to get to that moment was awe-striking and inspirational.

## Poetic Result

My friends and I do gambling pots for major international anythings. Any sport, any election, whatever. We just like paying attention to things and the few bucks we bet make up focus. I got Argentina as my first pick for the World Cup. I picked them because at that same 1996 Olympics where Micheal Johnson moved the earth, Nigera and Argentina played soccer in the finals. I was 8. I was at that game. I bought hat that looks silly (I'll post a picture if people care). I'm wearing that hat today. On GOAT Week. And I'll wear it all week.

Because I won the pool, my friends are each venmoing me $50 today. They don't know it, but I decided the other day that I'm leaving my current company and starting my own. I only have $0.53 in that business account because that's what 53rd bank does when you start an account and don't have cash or a check on hand. It's a pretty cool little trick. Today I tried to cash a bond from 1996 that my mother gave me this year for my birthday that she had also given me for my birthday on December 21, 1996 and told me to use it towards my business. I tried to deposit it in my new shiny 53rd business account to take off to the moon! (It ended up being worth only $112.72)

53rd bank does not allow people with new accounts to cash bonds. It's a fraud protection issue. They don't have your history in their bank to know you're not a scammer so they don't allow you to cash it. I don't dislike this rule, there may be language around it I misinterpreted. Regardless, this blocked me from making the first deposit into my business account to be from my mom from 26 years ago when I was 8 and had just watched the world move for the first time.

Now, I get to use the money I get from my friends for winning a pool that ended in a GOAT moment and me writing this post. That's even more poetic and I can't wait to deposit it... If Omelette du Fromage ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¾ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­ would send me the fucking $50 he owes me for winning the 2022 WEIR(L)D QUP!!
