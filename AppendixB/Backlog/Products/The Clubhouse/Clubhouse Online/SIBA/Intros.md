Good Afternoon Nerds!
If you've ever been interested in learning STEM or are a software enthusiast looking for an Open Source project to contribute to, https://github.com/NonpareilGaming/2kAPIs is the answer! I'm building a set of APIs to help streamline league processes! First up is combine 10s. They're always chaotic, let's make them simpler with software!
I'm an industry leading DevOps Architect that is literally flown out and paid to give speeches in order to educate other industry leaders. If you need my credentials: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-benton/ 
I'll be streaming NOW on https://www.twitch.tv/nonpareilnic come join! I'd love to give advice on STEM/coding as well as get design opinions from the community even if you have no interest in coding! Later I'll cut down what I can in the sessions into YouTube tutorials for educational purposes (whenever I have the time).
