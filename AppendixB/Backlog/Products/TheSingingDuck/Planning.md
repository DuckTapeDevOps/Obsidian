TheSingingDuck.com will be a site where you can search https://www.streamersonglist.com/ by song, genre, viewers, queue size, etc. Then you can make a request and it will send bits. Once that is requested, you will stay on the stream until your request is played and then stay there until 1 song after yours. This ensures that users learn a little about the streamer. I always will encourage streamers to play their favorite example of what their channel normally does immediately following the Singing Duck request.
