I am only a #hypothesis.

I once heard someone say " #Einstein said #compounded #interest is the most powerful force in the universe."

I thought "Yea, that makes sense in math! I invest in something, that gains interest, and then I gain interest on that new value!"

Look, that's powerful. But that's not the most powerful force in the universe. In order for that to work, the two things you need are money and time. Fuck... I don't have money and I way too impatient to wait on time.

So I figured, I'll look to see what else Einstein had to say.

Google: "What's Einstein's most popular theory?"

Einstein: "Time isn't relative!"

Yea man, I get that. I've experienced things very differently at different times. I'm an extremely passionate person when I find something I'm interested in. And I think I experience those moments of passion much differently than times of boredom.

Fuck... What's the relationship between time, interest, passion, and experience?

Wait.... let me think... maybe someone misheard Einstein! Maybe he wasn't talking about money.... He already thought time wasn't a valuable measure of experience....

So let me get this right. If time isn't relative, it's not relevant to your experiences. And how to you create moments of compunded experience?

That's Passion.

So if Interest breeds passion...

And passion multiplies your experience...

Then Interest multiplies your experience...

If that's true, "compounded interest is the most powerful force in the world."

Alright, maybe that guy Einstein was on to something! Someone just made assumptions about his true intent.

How do we compound our interest in something? How do we "create passion"?

I don't think we can. I think our #passions are part of our ID. BUT, I think we can recognize #passion. I think if you create nonpareil events (~"Outliers" Malcolm Gladwell) in your life, you will begin to find out if you are passionate about that. Then, you follow that. You gain Compounded Experience in that. You "succeed" in that efficiently.

I am an extremely passionate person.

And I fucking love it.

I am an extremely successful person.

And I fucking love it.

But I've failed over and over and over. I don't fail lightly. I fucking gun it. I fucking crash and I fucking burn. I cry. I get depressed. It hurts. But like the great philosopher Chumbawamba told me in Tubthumping, when I get knocked down, I get up again. You're never gonna keep me down.

My first passion was UNC basketball. My first big failure was school. So I applied to UNC and only UNC. I didn't know why I didn't apply to other schools. But I wanted to go there! I didn't get in. Knocked down, time to get up again.

~Bob: "I have a friend at HPU, you can go there, and I know you're not good enough at track to run at UNC, but I bet you could there!"

My second passion was pole vaulting! My second failure too. Good, not good enough. So I tried doing decathlon (only deviate a little!), nope. not it.

My third passion was saving lives. I wanted to be a doctor. But I wasn't passionate about school. So I decided I was going to fucking gun it. I joined the Air Force and I was going to be a Pararescueman. I was going to be the biggest badass in the world while saving lives. And FUCK was I passionate about it. I've never been so driven. I went to that school. The one they call superman school. And I fucking tried my fucking heart out. I wanted it so bad. But, I wasn't mentally strong enough. I failed. I cried. It was fucking tough.

I had told everyone what I was going to do. I bragged about it, I made people proud that I was going to do it. Not only did I need it, people around me started to be proud that I was going to do it. They started to brag about their friend that was going to be a PJ and save lives. I not only failed myself, but I failed them too.

This was my biggest failure. I even failed the people that I never got to save. This one always hurts.

Fuck it. I'm a fucking Tubthumpin!

One day, while half drowning and "popping up" from our long distance underwater swims at PJ Indoc, I come up with a plan.

If I'm not physically capable of doing my passion, I'm going to see what I'm intellectually capable of!

So I though: "Self, what's the most intelligent thing I can do in the military?"

For some reason: "Military Intelligence!"

But thank god was that my choice. Because what I learned there wasn't intelligence, but confidence. Colonel @BadAtHockey taught me about building your brand. About being confident. About not being afraid of sharing the information you have.

And the rest of the team taught me how to disambaguate information and retell it as a story that can be remembered.

I learned how to efficiently educate.

My next passion was logic. So I became an egineer. I'm successful at it.

So, if compounded interest (passion) leads to compounded experience (efficient learning) then how did I get to success?

Follow your passions. You'll learn about them the fastest. Follow them until you can't. Fucking fail. Fail as fucking hard as you can. Until you can logically decide on a better use for your time.

That's how you get experience in life. You create your own nonpareil events.

According to Malcolm Gladwell ~"It requires a certain number of outliers to line up for someone great to appear"

I want to be great. I want to be remembered.

I have created the nonpareil events necessary for me to become successful.

It's not about income. It's not about title. I don't even use my title on my LinkedIn. It just says "Nonpareil DevOps Dude" and hell, I may drop DevOps now.

I want to educate people; on how to be successful.

That's it. That's what I want to do. The passions I've had are helping people (saving lives), breaking down information intellectually and presenting it in a way that someone can learn (educating).

All my life I've been honing in on what I'm most passionate about. My nonpareil passion. I hope I've found. If not, I'll fucking find out.

Do what you're passionate about and you'll succeed.

That's it. That's all. The rest is just shit. I went into DevOps to make the money. Because it's a way to breakdown information and present it in a way that is readable (ETL). That's the part I'm good at. 

So this is me, publicly, confidently, assuredly, and logically. (engineer)

This is not out of pretension or ego. I've disambiguated those words and found my own definition of them.

I REALLY hope this is Altruistic.

I want to educate.

I'm good at failure.. I should probably start educating people on how to fail epically.
