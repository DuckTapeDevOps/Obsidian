How Video Games Helped My Depression

I talked to my sister today about my depression; about my diagnosis in the 6th grade. She wasn't around as much then, she lived with my dad and went to school in Laurinburg and I lived with my mom and went to school in Pinehurst. She asked "Are you still seeing a therapist and medicated?" So I started to wonder why I'm not.

My hypothesis on my depression and my response to it:

The first relationship I ever saw end was my parents'. Many people call a divorce a failure of a marriage, but my father always told me he cherished the 23 years they were together and considered it a successful marriage. This was my first understanding that what some people consider a failure, can be a success when used correctly.

I remember the first time I made an adult cry.

I was at a youth retreat some time around 4th or 5th grade and we were going around the circle saying what we were "thankful" for. Everyone said "my family!" or "the lord's love!". Well, I couldn't quantify those, I wasn't sure what my family was at that point, so I thought a little deeper. I said "I'm thankful for my parents' divorce. My life would have been perfect without it and I wouldn't be challenged." (Or whatever words a 4th grader uses to portray that idea) Little did I know, the parent leading the circle had recently been through a divorce and was worried about the effect on his child's life. Divorce didn't negatively effect me as a whole, it taught me important lessons. I hope that kid is happy and successful today. I know I am.

I remember when I first moved and had to make new friends.

When my mom tried to find her own post-marriage success, she decided to become a realtor. I even remember helping her with her class work. So when I went to the 6th grade and we were figuring out where I would go, we decided on O'Neal. Pinehurst was a much better realestate market and O'Neal was a prestigiousschool, and I had earned an academic scholarship to help me attend the private institute.

This was where I started to develop trust issues.

I had one friend from Laurinburg going with me to O'Neal. I'm not looking to call them out, they reached out to me years ago, told me they were looking to help troubled children and wanted to apologize for everything. At the time, I wasn't ready to forgive them. I hadn't settled my own mind yet and it was my decision when to forgive, I had to come to that decision on my own, just like every other decision I've ever made. I forgive them.

Things got dark.

When I went to O'Neal, I knew one person. In middle school, you decide to pick on people in order to try to become popular. If you know things about the other new kid, you pick on them. Then everyone did. My grades dropped and I lost my scholarship. I went to get tested for ADHD (I have it, I've been diagnosed recently) and the therapist diagnosed me with depression instead. I rejected this hypothesis. Depression had too negative of a connotation, I wasn't looking to be depressed, I was looking to unscramble my brain. I was depressed.

I became SpamBurger

When you're depressed, you don't want to do anything. You don't want to move, you don't want to go anywhere. I turned to video games. I found a way to be who I am and find people that would accept me; because, in the video game world, skill trumps all. If you're good enough, intelligent enough, and kind enough people will like you because you win. So I created my first video game avatar "SpamBurger". I think it was randomly assigned but I thought it was silly enough to fit my personality.

I became a winner.

As SpamBurger, I was top 10 in the world at one point on SOCOM: Navy Seals. No one could deny that I had value in video games. This didn't help at school. So I tried to be "cool" and I changed it from SpamBurger to SpamDawg. Then I created Wuupas on Everquest because I wanted to whoop ass! I wanted to be "cooler". I wanted the "cool" kids to stop picking on me. I just wanted to be "normal" but I'm not. Not by a long shot. I'm special.

SpamDawg wasn't me. Wuupas wasn't me. I had to find myself. I changed my avatars again.

Enter Reemas (and his brother)

My step brother is, to this day, one of the most intelligent and kind people I've ever met. We're not as close anymore, but he saved me. He gave me one of his characters "Reemas". It was a play on his character Meeras Tafari (based on his father living in the Caribbean). Whether he knew it or not, I was Reemas. My avatars changed to varying names relating to Remus and Romulus. They were raised by wolves and didn't understand humans at all. Yep, sounds like me so far. Despite that, they built Rome. Possibly the greatest feat in the history of mankind. I wanted to be like them. I was misunderstood, but seeking greatness.

I am unique and nonpareil!

Enter NonpareilNic

I eventually came to grips with who I was in high school. I began to prove the bullies wrong by beating them in sports. In fact, they were polevaulting with me and trying to get me to fight them daily. But I was outperforming them and beating them in pole vaulting every day. Prove them wrong. You're better. Fuck 'em. I decided to change my video game avatar again. I no longer needed to pretend to be Remus and Romulus, I needed to start my own story. So I googled synonyms for "great". And this mattered to me, so I spent time looking. I found the word nonpareil. It means "no parallel, unrivalled". I became NonpareilNic. I was me. I am unrivalled.

I am successful.

No one would look at my life and deny that. But it didn't come easy. Some of us didn't make it. I've had friends along the way lose the battle. I've always wanted to save lives. I thought I had to be a doctor or a PJ to do it. But now, all I want to be is myself. And I want to find others like me and show them that that's enough. That you can prove everyone else wrong and just be yourself and be successful.

I want to educate people like me.

I am nonpareil.
