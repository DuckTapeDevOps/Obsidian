Today I was listening to an episode of JD Off Leash and heard the battle of Ukraine explained in a very interesting way. I'm paraphrasing the actual situation, listen to the podcast linked to hear the actual accounting of it.

Husband who's starting to realize the gravity of the threat to his life while living in Ukraine and the impending front line that's inching closer and closer to his front door: "Honey, I think we should move to your mother's in Kyiv. She called me today and said she has 10 free rooms and will cook us dinner every night if we come stay there for a while."

Wife who's planning their daughter's birthday party: "Look, stop talking about the war. The front line is 100 miles away. We'll worry about that next week. Did you make the reservation for our daughter's birthday at that restaurant that still has waitstaff? I want her 5th birthday to be a good one!"

I've offered for the last 6 months that if people donate to this link: [https://donorbox.org/ballsoffwalls](https://donorbox.org/ballsoffwalls) I'll match it. In that 6 months, it's gotten $75. I didn't just match that. For the last ~6 months I've been giving $1,200 a month to the organisation. I've also thrown a charity event where I interviewed JD and I got about 20 people to show up. People donated. I love those people. Please go look at the organisation. Please listen to the podcast. Then make your own decision. I've made mine. And I'm starting a few new charity campaigns for the charities I care about. Stay tuned. I'm not asking for money. I'm asking people to educate themselves. Then, if you decide you want to help, do that. Or ask me how.
