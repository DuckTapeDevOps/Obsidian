For someone that has always had an issue with commitment, it's only ironic that the only way I'd ever be committed was involuntarily. 

After the episode which I will, as a reminder and warning, continue to call 988 my mother decided she needed to make an emergency flight to me. My mother and step-father stay in Clearwater, Florida at a retirement park any chance they can to get away from daily life. It used to belong to my mother's mother "Mimi" and her step-father Woody. I stayed there with my favorite grandfather, Woody for a week or so once as an adult. It is my fondest memory of any of my grandparents. Woody was the nicest man you'd ever meet with some of the worst fates you'd ever see. He burried two wives and a son before the world finally stopped beating him up and allowed him to rest in his mid 90s. He was a veteran of World War II. Like my father, he'd never consider himself a veteran because he never deployed. This trend seems to haunt my family in an odd way. I never deployed either and often have what's called Survivor's Guilt. I don't know if Survivor's Guilt PTSD or actual combat PTSD is worse, but I'm not willing to go find out. On NYE, the historical average in Clearwater is 62.7 degrees. This year, it was 70 degrees. All to say, she made a giant effort to come help me in my time of need and I'll always remember that act even if I'm not great at showing it.
