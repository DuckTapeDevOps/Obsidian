## Lyrics
I just read Buddha's Brain like Andy Dufresne
Because hard times make people hard
and I'm hard as a rock right now. (Now I've got ya thinkin about my cock)

## The connections

"I love how you're just now coming across all my favorite tik tokers". Then I knew. We were being tracked because of me only sharing posts with her lately. Then I realized it's chat GPT. Then I realize a layer beyond that is OpenAI. But lets go back up that tree a bit now that we've found *our* root. The next branch up, back through the ChatGPT is EvanBotPro. EvanDotPro's bot that he lets me keep on my twitch channel. "Fuck you @evanbotpro". That'll get him! I love talking to @evanbotpro like my rival. Because If he's the Matrix, I'm fucking Neo. But I'm both Neo and the Architect. I'm the first architect. Or, if he's Neo, I'm on his team. And Now that venture begins. Now I start the prequel to the Matrix. In real time, as one of the characters. *ctrl + S* "git add . "


To Harleen: LUL

I am writing this as an analogy to the things I'm getting into with AI and people's other analogies with AI to The Matrix. I am taking artistic liberties and am not delusional. This is just me, playing a game and having fun and hoping someone else will enjoy watching me to do it!
