## Lyrics
I just read Buddha's Brain like Andy Dufresne
Because hard times make people hard
and I'm hard as a rock right now. (Now I've got ya thinkin about my cock)

## The connections

Girl I'd been sending Facebook messages to: "I love how you're just now coming across all my favorite tik tokers"

Then I knew. We were linked via -insert correct term here- because of me only sharing posts with her lately. 

Then I realized it's chat GPT. 

Then I realize a layer beyond that is OpenAI. 

But lets go back up that tree a bit now that we've found *our* root. The next branch up, back through the ChatGPT is EvanBotPro. This is my friend EvanDotPro's bot that he lets me keep on my twitch channel. 

"Fuck you @evanbotpro". 

That'll get him! I love talking to @evanbotpro like my rival. Because If he's the Matrix, I'm fucking Neo. Maybe not Neo, but the architect... Or, if he's Neo, I'm on his team. And now that venture begins. Now I start the prequel to the Matrix. In real time, as one of the characters.
