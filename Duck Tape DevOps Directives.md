1) Naming variables is the hardest challenge in creating (software).
2) Never cheapen your art by calling it content
3) Always be self masturbatory until someone else does it for you
	1) #Absolute 
4) When building a house, start with the infrastructure (the foundation), progress to the plumbing (APIS), paint the interior (CI/CD), then finish with a beautiful external paint job (UI). But you don't start building the house by just throwing pieces together. You start with an architectural plan that ensure all of the infrastructure, plumbing, facade, etc. will come together as cleanly as possible. Poor planning leads to poor execution.
5) Make it work, make it right, make it fast.
	1) Make it work:
		1) Create the Mimimum Viable Product (MVP).
			1) MVP is an achieveable goal that has a boolean/binary answer.
		2) "Perfection is the enemy of progress" - who knows. I've heard this a ton.
	2) Compound the Obtain, Process, and Push process (COPP) (Make it right):
		3) #Compound 
		4) #Extract 
			1) #learn 
			2) #Obtain 
				1) #UnobtainiumÂ is a term used in fiction, engineering, and common situations for a material ideal for a particular application but impractically hard to get.
		5) #Transform (more than meets the eye)
			1) #Process
		6) #Load
			1) #Educate
			2) #Push
			3) 
		7) Make it easier to understand. Create a journey through your code. It starts at the ReadME and doesn't stop until the reader has caught up to your expierence. Educate the next enthusiast and lead them to contribute their knowledge to your database.
		8) Make it ETL. When someone extracts the code from your work, ensure that the way it transforms in their mind before they load back into their own system includes a deep education for compounded ETL
		9) Make the actual ETL process. Do DevOps. Add CI/CD. Automate your COPE to get to ACOPP (Automated Compounded Obtain Proccess Push).
			1) ACCEPPT (Automate Compound Compound Experience Process Transformation)
	3) Make it fast:
		1) Make it efficient. Clean it up in a way that speeds up both creation and education. This will minimize the the referencial experience loss (REL).
			1) #Referencial #Experience #Loss (REL):
				1) When educating, we use our #experiences. We're referencing them. The experience a student get when learning is referencial to yours as an educator. The quality of the #education and the #interest of the student will determin the #REL.
	4) Be Open Source:
		1) #Conway's #Law : ~ "Build your organization the way you expect your product to work."
			1) Always be #absolute about your own abilities. If you are honest with yourself, you'll always be open to differing #experiences and in turn, #assumptions; it will only make you more #profilic.

#NAK : #Noers  #Absolutely #Know : Know what you know. Be confident in that. But always be willing to change your opinion when given new facts based on superior #experience. That opinion should always be #Absolute . I can't call them Nakkers... I'll have to change it up. Always be willing to challenge someone's #experience and therefore their #assumptions .

6) Treat your projects, ideas, and software the same way you use your servers in the cloud. They are cattle. Not pets. If they execute incorrectly and are unable to feed yourself, go get new cattle and raise it diffferently based on your new learnings.
